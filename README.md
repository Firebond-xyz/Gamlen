## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

1. As we know blockchain gaming scope is increasing day by day . We also know that in most of the Blockchain games the characters are in the form of Non fungible tokens . So we can create a marketplace where users can sell and buy the characters . But  the problem with traditional gaming marketplace is : Nfts metadata reveals all the attributes and information about the character . Some information may be sensetive that can affect the privacy of owner of nft . 

2. The existing NFT marketplace may suffer from a lack of trust regarding the authenticity and attributes of the game characters. Buyers might hesitate to invest in NFTs due to concerns about fraudulent or misrepresented attributes. 

 3. Without a reliable mechanism to verify the attributes of NFT game characters, buyers might have to rely solely on the claims made by sellers. This lack of verifiability can create uncertainty and deter potential buyers. 
 
  Other than this there are some more restriction existing in blockchain gaming ecosystem : 
 
 4. Many gamers and NFT collectors may own valuable gaming assets that are not actively being used at all times. By enabling lending and renting of gaming asset NFTs, we can  allows asset owners to generate value from their idle assets by making them available for others to use. This maximizes the utility of assets and creates a more efficient marketplace.
 
 5. Some players may not have the means or resources to acquire high-value gaming assets. By providing a platform for lending and renting, your dapp enables gamers to gain access to rare or valuable assets without having to purchase them outright. This promotes inclusivity and allows a broader range of players to experience and enjoy premium gaming content.
